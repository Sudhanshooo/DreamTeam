Oh, how can i forget that day, I was just mesmerised and lost all my senses the time I looked into her eyes that day every little moment of that day is just so crystal clear in my head even now. All my fears and every denial that I put myself in just went away. I knew this was it. I knew I loved her and someday I would let her know of that but even if she didn't I wouldn't stop. Because i never felt something so unconditional and true for someone before. It was different, strong and very real</p>

And now that she did, all my fears vanished, all my thoughts vanished I loved her and she accepted me, I had so many thoughts so much excitement and I didn't want to stop kissing her. I just didn't know what to say at that point of time but all i knew was, I LOVE THIS GIRL AND I AM NOT LETTING HER GO. I WILL HOLD ON. To all the fears she might have, WE WILL FIGHT THEM TOGETHER, and that's how we took first step to this journey. OUR JOURNEY.</p>
